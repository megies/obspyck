* simple location of a Geysers eq
* Requires hyp 1.3 or greater and uses 4th generation station delay files

* These are standard Northern Calif network startup commands:
LET 5 2 3 2 2				/Use new, longer SEED station codes
RMS 4 .10 2 3				/Residual weighting
ERR .10					/Standard timing error
POS 1.78				/P to S ratio
REP T F			/Log events to terminal; don't print unweighted stations
MIN 4					/Min number of stations
NET 2					/Use California region codes
ZTR 5					/Trial depth
DI1 1 50 3 6				/Initial Distance weighting
DIS 4 15 3.5 7				/Main Distance weighting
WET 1. .5 .2 .1				/Weights for P weight codes 0-3

* OUTPUT FORMAT
ERF T					/Send error messages to terminal
*TOP F					/No page ejects
*LST 2 0 1				/station list or models in printfile
*KPR 2					/Medium print output each event
H71 2 2 2				/Use hypo71 summary format for this test

* STATION DATA
TYP Read in stations:
STA 'stations.dat'    			 /Read ASCII file of all stations.

* CRUSTAL MODEL
TYP Read in crustal model(s):
CRH 1 'gey.crh'

* CHOOSE THE PREFERED MAG FROM THE EXTERNAL MAG OR DURATION MAG CALCULATED HERE
* Preferred mag, min readings, mag range. In preference order.
*PRE 6, 3 0 3 9, 1 1 0 9, 2 1 0 9, 4 4 4 9, 3 0 0 9, 4 0 0 9 /Preferred mags

* SET DEFAULT PHASE FILE BUT GIVE USER A CHANCE TO CHANGE IT
PHS 'hyp2000.pha'
FIL					/Examine phase file and set its format

* SET DEFAULT PRINT FILE BUT GIVE USER A CHANCE TO CHANGE IT
PRT 'hypo.prt'
