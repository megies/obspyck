0.4.1
 - fix minor bug that prevents 0.4.0 from running

0.4.0
 - add support for fetching data from a seedlink server
 - set meaningful creation info including obspyck+obspy version numbers on all
   event objects
 - fix a bug with beachball function naming in 0.3.0 (likely to lead to
   RunTimeErrors)

0.3.0
 - switch obspy dependency version from 0.10.* to 1.*

0.2.0
