master
 - add support for magnitude estimation for data fetched from an FDSN server
   (using full response)
 - depending on obspy >=1.1.0 now
 - add support for scrolling along time axis with mouse wheel + modifier
   (by default "alt" key, see #45)
 - fix station metadata output in hypo71 format (for location routines)
   for longitude <0 (see #47)
 - fix horizontal errors read after hyp2000 location (conversion from km to m
   was missing, see #48)
 - add possibility to use other phase names besides the default "P" and "S" in
   picking. this is highly experimental, especially when using location
   routines most internals are very likely still using hard coded "P" and "S"
   values, but for picking and saving to QuakeML only this reportedly works
   (see #36).
 - also show picks in the GUI that lack location code in the corresponding
   QuakeML file (but such picks will not be associated to any one of the
   Stream's axes, so it will not be possible to modify or delete them via the
   GUI, see #49 and #51)

0.4.1
 - fix minor bug that prevents 0.4.0 from running
 - switch obspy dependency version from >=1.* to >1.0.3 (the import reroutes in
   obspy 1.0.x break the monkey patching of event object classes in obspyck)

0.4.0
 - add support for fetching data from a seedlink server
 - set meaningful creation info including obspyck+obspy version numbers on all
   event objects
 - fix a bug with beachball function naming in 0.3.0 (likely to lead to
   RunTimeErrors)

0.3.0
 - switch obspy dependency version from 0.10.* to 1.*

0.2.0
 - packaging cleanup

0.1.0
 - initial release with proper package structure and versioning
